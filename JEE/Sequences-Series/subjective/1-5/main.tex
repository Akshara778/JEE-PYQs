    \item The harmonic mean of two numbers is 4. Their arithmetic mean $A$ and the geometric mean $G$ satisfy the relation.
    \\
    $2A + G^2 = 27$
    \\
    Find the two numbers.  \hfill\brak{1979}

\item The interior angles of a polygon are in arithmetic progression. The smallest angle is $120\degree$ and the common difference is $5\degree$ Find the number of sides of the polygon.

\hfill\brak{1980}

    \item Does there exist a geometric progression containing 27, 8 and 12 as three of its terms? If it exits, how many such progressions are possible?  \hfill\brak{1982-3 Marks}

    \item Find three numbers $a,b,c$ between 2 and 18 such that
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item their sum is 25
    \item the numbers $2,a,b$ are consecutive terms of an A.P.
    \\
    and
    \item the numbers $b,c,18$ are consecutive terms of a G.P.\hfill\brak{1983-2 Marks}
    \end{enumerate}
  

    \item If $a>0,b>0,c>0$, prove that
    \\
    $\brak{a+b+c}\brak{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}}\geq9$
