%\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider all possible permutations of the ENDEANOEL. Match the Statements/ Expressions in
\textbf{Column I} with the Statements/ Expressions in \textbf{Column II} and indicate your answer by darkening
the appropriate bubbles in the 4x 4 matrix given in the ORS.\hfill $(2008)$\\  
    




\begin{tabular}{p{0.5cm}p{9cm}p{1.5cm}p{2cm}}
& \textbf{Column I } & & \textbf{Column II}\\ \\
 (A) & The number of permutations containing the word ENDEA is & \raggedleft (p) & 5! \\
    (B) & The number of permutations in which the letter E occurs in the first and the last positions is & \raggedleft(q) & $2\times{5!}$\\
    (C)& The number of permutations in which none of the letters & \raggedleft (r) &$7\times{5!}$\\
    (D) & The number of permutations in which the letters A, E, O occur only in odd positions is & \raggedleft (s) & $21\times{5!}$

\item In a high school, a committee has to be formed from a group of 6 boys $M_1,M_2,M_3,M_4,M_5,M_6$ and 5 girls $G_1,G_2,G_3,G_4,G_5$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $\alpha_1$ be the total number of ways in which the committee can be formed such that the committee has 5 members, having exactly 3 boys and 2 girls. 
    \item Let $\alpha_2$ be the total number of ways in which the committee can be formed such that the committee has at least 2 members and having an equal number of boys and girls
    \item Let $\alpha_3$ be the total number of ways in which the committee can be formed such that the committee has 5 members, at least 2 of them being girls. 
    \item Let $\alpha_4$ be the total number of ways in which the committee can be formed such that the committee has 4 members, having at least 2 girls and such that both $M_1$ and $G_1$ are not $\mathbf{NOT} $ are not in the committee. \\
