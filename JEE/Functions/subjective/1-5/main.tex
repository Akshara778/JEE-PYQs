\item Find the domain and the range of the function $f\brak{x}+\frac{x^2}{1+x^2}$.Is the function one one?

\item Draw the graph of $y=\abs x^{\frac{1}{2}}$ for $-1\le x \le1.$

\item If $f\brak{x}=x^9-6x^8-2x^7+12x^6+x^4-7x^3+6x^2+x-3$ find $f\brak{x}$

\item Consider the following relations in the set of real numbers R.

$R=\{\brak{x,y}:x\in R,y\in R,x^2+y^2\le25\}$
$R^1=\{\brak{x,y}:x\in R,y\in R,y\ge\frac{4}{9}x^2\}$

Find the domain and the range of$ R\cap R^1.$ Is the relation$ R\cap R^1$ a function?

\item Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets each with a finite number of elements. Assume that there is an injective mapping from $A$ to $B$ and that there is an injective mapping from $B$ to $A$.Prove that there is a bijective mapping from $A$ to $B$.
